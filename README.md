# cybersecurity-audit-framework

### Motivation

A secure internet is all of our responsibility. Security should be as transparent a process as possible. Where a lack of security could pose a significant risk, an objective report of a platform's security practices should be made available. This framework aims to provide a method for performing a security audit that results in an informative, objective report after the audit is completed.

## High-level Outline of framework
* Education: who, what, why and how of an audit.
Who can provide it (certs of auditors, who can be involved and in what role).
What it covers (standards used, expectations)
* Documentation: A company to be audited needs to have internal documentation of security controls.
* Agreements: Mostly Audit Prep and the Rules of Engagement, but also NDA's, SLA, contracts, etc.
* Requirements: If this project was a software application, the reqs are the input. How does the framework deal with requirements? How are they categorized, and how does it change the testing?
* Testing: The actual auditing
* Reporting: Output of tests and the results of an audit
* Transparency: How does the framework decide between public and private outputs? How does it provide objectivity?
* Citation: The research/standards behind why this is all useful

## Ongoing tasks
* What is the domain of the project? It should in the least cover a basic public web applications (in browser application, web server)
* How to organize the framework
* What to include, what not to include: what to test, how to test, tools used
* Reporting: How are reports created? Which are private? public? what's the final report look like?

## Process overview
1. Document controls internally
2. The Auditor
3. Audit planning based on documented controls and scope
4. Security control assessment (the tests)
5. Reports

## Testing

* Pentests are going to be a large module on their own
* Vulnerability checklist
* Scans: DB, Network, infrastructure
* Configuration: Headers, TLS test, etc
* Documentation Review (the target's documented controls are accurate/effective)
* Personnel Interviews
* compliance
